Platform and language-independent data exchange standards for describing and enriching agentic processes optimized for Large Language Models (LLM). 

**Design Principles, the standard**

1. Allows LLMs to parse related data for better reasoning capabilities while minimizing the need for pre- or post-processing.
2. Supports rich contextual information, such as dependencies, constraints, decision criteria, goals, and environmental factors.
3. Remains usable across operating systems, different LLMs, and agentic frameworks.
4. Remains independent of a specific programming language.
5. Expands to accommodate new types of processes, actions, events, data artefacts and other contextual information.

Supported data formats: XML, YAML, JSON, CSV, TOML.
